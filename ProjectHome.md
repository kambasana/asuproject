The aim of the project is to create a modular web framework that would allow anyone to download software and driver updates like Windows updates but not brand specific.

The current road map is:

ASU Mobile  - Mobile software updating
ASU Manage  - Centralised management of multiple ASU servers
ASU Server  - ASU Core server
ASU Embeded - Embeded ASU for software / firmware updating for example network equipment
ASU Boot    - ASU Boot CD for Server versions and Clients
ASU Client - ASU Desktop and Remote Web Client

I am looking for programmers and anyone interested in this project.
